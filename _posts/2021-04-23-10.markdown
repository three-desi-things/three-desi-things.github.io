<h2 class="fact__hed">Unknown stories of women from the Mughal era</h2>

We talk to her about her book [_Daughters of the Sun_](https://www.amazon.com/DAUGHTERS-SUN-Empresses-Queens-Begums/dp/9386021129) and how the colonial Orientalist gaze has given us a lopsided view of the women from the Mughal period &mdash; and why she refuses to use the word &lsquo;harem&rsquo;. She breaks our hearts about the beloved Akbar and Birbal (yes, Jodhaa Akbar also comes up). But she also shows us how desi women have been denied the stories of powerful role models, and how she&rsquo;s changing that narrative.Â 

We also talk about her upcoming book Song of Draupadi, which will feature the strong women of the Mahabharata.

Today we embark on a new type of episode for Three Desi Things. We’re calling this our ‘In Dialoguee’ series. We will be interviewing authors, experts, and generally cool desis about the things that interest them the most and the stories that they want to tell. 

In this episode, we explore the science behind Indian cooking with Krish Ashok, an author, blogger, techie, and self-proclaimed science nerd. Ashok’s new book, [_Masala Lab_](https://www.amazon.com/Masala-Lab-Science-Indian-Cooking/dp/0143451375), is a fascinating take on documenting the subcontinent&rsquo;s rich food heritage using scientific techniques.


We discuss the idea of “burning the recipe” and using chemistry, the love of cooking, and trusting your tastebuds to produce culinary masterpieces. We delve deep into the science of kitchen “hacks” that our mothers have been using for ages, the many uses for Taco Bell fire sauce, and Veda’s favorite topic – MILLETS!

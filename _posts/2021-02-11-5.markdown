<h2 class="fact__hed">“Burn the recipe”</h2>

In this episode, we explore the science behind Indian cooking with the man who wears many hats — blogger, techie, self-proclaimed science nerd, and most recently, author. His new book, [_Masala Lab_](https://www.amazon.com/Masala-Lab-Science-Indian-Cooking/dp/0143451375), is a fascinating take on documenting the subcontinent&rsquo;s rich food heritage using scientific techniques.


We discuss the idea of “burning the recipe” and using chemistry, the love of cooking, and trusting your tastebuds to produce culinary masterpieces. We delve deep into the science of kitchen “hacks” that our mothers have been using for ages, the many uses for Taco Bell fire sauce, and Veda’s favorite topic – MILLETS!

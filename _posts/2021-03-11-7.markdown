<h2 class="fact__hed">Game of Thrones, Bollywood version?</h2>
Beth is a treasure trove of film trivia and Bollywood films, in general. She goes by [@bethlovesbolly](https://twitter.com/bethlovesbolly) on Twitter. We talk to her about how she got into Bollywood, what one should watch if you want to start watching Bollywood films. And we also play our "Guess the inspiration" game with her.

But most importantly, we talk about her amazing Bollywood family trees &mdash; [the Kapoors](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VTo3xNbZShKUVUQMsgaxEH2zlnRwGZHz/view), the [Mukherjees](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19tENX-762cSIkZcQrjWmH0TBOhhoIsQu/view), and many others.

For starters, here is the Mukherjee family tree. Notice the links between several big Bollywood families and dynasties. Also, an intriguing Satyajit Ray connection.

As a bonus, here is a Kapoor family tree from an old [Filmfare magazine](https://www.filmfare.com/) that Beth gave us.
